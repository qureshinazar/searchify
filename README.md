# About Project

This project is a simple, responsive webpage that allows users to dynamically search and filter a list of items using a search input field. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, it demonstrates basic front-end web development skills.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can type in the search bar to filter the displayed list.  
- **Text Highlighting**: Matches are highlighted in bold within the list items.  
- **Responsive Design**: The page is styled with Bootstrap for a clean and responsive layout.  
- **Lightweight and Simple**: No external libraries are used beyond Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript.

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the page.  
- **CSS**: Custom styles to enhance visual appeal.  
- **Bootstrap**: Adds responsiveness and consistent design.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements the search and filtering functionality.

## How It Works  
1. The list is displayed as a series of `<li>` elements inside an unordered list (`<ul>`).  
2. When the user types in the search bar, a JavaScript function filters the list based on the input:  
   - Items matching the query are displayed with the match highlighted in bold.  
   - Non-matching items are hidden.
